# exercise_classification
This project  uses live camera feed to classify between 3 types of exercises: Press, Curling and Squat. And also gives the rep count of the exercises. This is  using LSTM and attention mechanism to do so.
OpenCV is being used here along with mediapipe to detect the type of exercise.
